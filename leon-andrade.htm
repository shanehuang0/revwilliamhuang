      <p align="center"><strong>STATUS on SUSPECT, LEON ANDRADE</strong></p>
      <p>Mar. 12 (Sunday) ~10:35pm &ndash; Leon Andrade slashed Reverend William Huang with a machete 3 times on his face and once at the back of his head - Huang died of a severe blow to the back of his head leaving a big hole in his head and a shattered skull. He also lost his thumb while trying to defend his face. The blood was found in front of the restaurant by his car, but his body was found in the alley where he was trying to escape. There were 3 eyewitnesses (the criminal&rsquo;s wife and daughter whom Reverend William Huang was trying to protect and an eyewitness that pulled up during the event)</p>
      <p> Mar. 14 (Tuesday) &ndash; it was reported that the suspect was spotted in same Houston neighborhood where he lived. Police were unsuccessful in finding him after the report was called in. &ldquo;It was during traffic hour so it took too long to get there.&rdquo; &ndash; Phillip J. Guerrero, Sr. Police Investigator in the Homicide Division - Chicano Squad</p>
      <p>Mar. 15, 4pm (Wednesday) &ndash; &ldquo;suspect called two different persons in Houston this morning between 1:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. These two people then called CrimeStoppers and gave the same phone number that he was calling from. The phone number comes back to an SBC line in Dallas, but is a non-assigned phone number. I received a call from CrimeStoppers this afternoon and forwarded a GB to Dallas PD. I will e-mail his photo tomorrow morning to their Violent Offenders Task Force.&rdquo; &ndash; Phillip J. Guerrero, Sr. Police Investigator in the Homicide Division - Chicano Squad</p>
      <p> Mar. 20, 8pm (Monday) &ndash; &ldquo;The suspect's van was found in Sharpsburg, Georgia, a small unincorporated town outside of Marietta. The Coweta County Sheriff's office spoke with a witness who told them that he had given the suspect a ride to the Greyhound bus terminal in Atlanta. The suspect told him that he was going to catch a bus to Asheville, North Carolina, and then catch a cab to Morganton. Both cities are small, but have small areas of Hispanics. The suspect's photo and information has been forwarded to these 2 cities. Coweta Sheriff's office is trying to get any video surveillance from Greyhound stations to see if the suspect can be seen. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is going to be called to process the van and recover any evidence. The evidence will then be sent here to be processed. Several beer cans with labels indicating they were from Texas were found in the field. They have not entered the van and I told them to go ahead because it was considered abandoned and a search warrant was not needed. Sgt. Kennedy said that it appeared that there was some clothing in the van and they will also recover that.&rdquo; - Phillip J. Guerrero, Sr. Police Investigator in the Homicide Division - Chicano Squad</p>
      <p> Mar. 22, 9am (Wednesday) &ndash; &ldquo;No update since March 20th update. No update on the evidence found in van or if weapon was found in van. We are waiting for them to contact us&rdquo; - Phillip J. Guerrero, Sr. Police Investigator in the Homicide Division - Chicano Squad<br>
        Leon Andrade Criminal History in HOUSTON only</p>
      <p> 1991 &ndash; Murder/Manslaughter (No Bill), not in Houston since case number does not exist in their system. D.A. office is actively searching for case details currently.</p>
      <p>1997, 2002, 2004 arrests (carrying weapon, multiple DUI&rsquo;s, DWI, etc)</p>
      <p> Last 15 years: 5 assaults, 2 DWI&rsquo;s, 1 Discharge of firearm in public place.</p>
      <p>Family reports to police:</p>
      <p> Arrested several times &ndash; 3 assaults reported on wife</p>
      <p>Dec. 19, 2005 earlier &ndash; 911 call cancelled from Seferina&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s house</p>
      <p> Dec. 19, 2005 around midnight &ndash; Seferina&rsquo;s sister reported her car shot up by Leon Andrade &ndash; bullet holes in door and bumper of her car</p>
      <p> Dec 21, 2005 &ndash; called in report of Leon&rsquo;s green van driving by Seferina&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s house</p>
      <p> Jan. 9, 2006 &ndash; Leon Andrade held Seferina&rsquo;s sister up at gun point threatening violence and whereabouts of Seferina</p>
      <p> March 12, 2006 around 6pm &ndash; Seferina&rsquo;s sister once again threatened by Leon Andrade on whereabouts of Seferina (after this threat, Leon Andrade followed Seferina&rsquo;s sister to Lucky Seafood Restaurant to warn Seferina about Leon)</p>
      <p> March 12, 2006, around 10:35pm &ndash; Murdered Rev. William Huang with machete and fled in same green van</p>
      <p>**This criminal is an illegal alien and has not been put behind bars properly even with his long criminal history because the victims are mostly illegal aliens that DO NOT want to be discovered themselves (his criminal history is most likely shorter than actual crimes he has committed due to the same reason). So someone like Andrade will continue his criminal activity in our country because he gets away with it so easily - none of the illegal aliens will press charges OR turn him in since it&rsquo;s not worth their freedom in America (may be what happened with the murder/manslaughter he was charged with in 1991). This is a huge immigration issue because what happens is criminals that are illegal aliens get away with more than a citizen can and victims/witnesses stay silent &ndash; both of which are crimes that our country should not tolerate. The silent victims played a factor in my father&rsquo;s death just as much as Andrade did.</p>

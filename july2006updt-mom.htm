      <p>As I am typing this email, I still debate if I should send it out. </p>
      <p> State Rep. Martha Wong called and asked ‘what else can I do for you?’. 
        I paused and said nothing. The case is open on the boss of the Sergeant’s 
        desk. U.S. Marshals are helping. The billboard at Richmond and Hilcroft 
        has the picture of Leon Andrade. I am typing this and wondering what else 
        should I do? I didn’t even want to tell you that Leon Andrade has not 
        been caught. Sergeant ensures me that Leon’s fingerprints are on the national 
        databases and that all States are using for verifying all suspects.</p>
      <p> I spent a lot of times to do my research for the case. I contact HPD 
        weekly and push from different directions – Senators, State Representatives, 
        Houston Coucilmen, Crimestoppers and Media - all of them were very helpful. 
        I learned so much. Yes, I am very disappointed about the system but the 
        story goes and touches more life beyond my expectations. </p>
      <p> For the last four months, I held on the word of God and His Grace is 
        sufficient. I re-organized Hsing Wei’s preaching and singing tapes. His 
        life was amazing, his love toward God, his country and his family are 
        always the same. The Holy Spirit reminds me of the conversation I had 
        with Hsing Wei before he was murdered. He told me the restaurant was his 
        sanctuary and I remember he died on Sunday – he preached “Love” by action. 
        Here is what C.S.Lewis writes about the risks of love: </p>
      <p><em><strong>&quot;To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and 
        your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to 
        make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not 
        even to an animal. Wrap it carefully around with hobbies and little luxuries 
        . . . lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But 
        in that casket-- safe, dark, motionless, airless--it will change. It will 
        not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable 
        . . . The only place outside heaven where you can be perfectly safe from 
        all the dangers of love is hell!&quot; </strong></em></p>
      <p>Then I decided to send this email out because Love should not fear. I 
        know you are there to pray for me and this email reaches you in a form 
        of thank you. Some of you took care of my children, took me out for dinners, 
        or email/called me to comfort and to listen. Guide me if I got lost in 
        the traffic. My boss and my co-workers are patient with my performance 
        at work. So many little things that you did for me. </p>
      <p>In God with Faith, Hope and Love,</p>
      <p>Lena Huang</p>

      <p>Baba always prays and I know he was praying at that moment. </p>
      <p> I love to ask him &lsquo;So, what did God say this time?&rsquo; and 
        he always amazed me with his answers.</p>
      <p>He told me the 5 year plan inspired by God &ndash; After Shane goes tolaw 
        school after the Army, Charlotte will be in college and Christian will 
        follow us to places. He said God gave him the restaurant just like Apostle 
        Paul &ndash; make a living and get ready for the next mission. </p>
      <p>I know he was praying when the madman tried to kill him, I know he was asking God what to do next. </p>
      <p>Many times, he requested the whole family to pray during the crisis. 
        The time Jade was hit by my car while she was loading her swimming stuff 
        at 5 am - he requested we all hold hands to pray before going into the 
        hospital. Then we walked in the E.R. and discharged the next hour. The 
        time my purse was stolen from the car where I took Christian to a swim 
        lesson. The time when we called Jade home to be with Popo&rsquo;s last 
        hour. The time he found out Patrick was not Baptist yet &ndash; one week 
        before the wedding and I told him no way you can get a place to perform 
        the baptism and Patrick is a believer anyway. He told me he promised God 
        he won&rsquo;t perform wedding vow to non-believer nor walk his daughter 
        to a non-Baptist man &ndash; he kept the promise. Baba said God protected 
        him from 3 things that tempt a servant the most &ndash; power, sex and 
        money. </p>
      <p> I don&rsquo;t know what God told him during the last prayer.</p>
      <p> God lifted him up to heaven for two hours the day he accepted Jesus 
        as his savior - the year he graduated from college. He promised God he 
        would be a full time servant for Him despite my objection. He promised 
        God that one of his kids will serve Him full time but don&rsquo;t know 
        which one. I was joking and said &lsquo;Shane is too good-looking to be 
        a pastor and Christian will not fit into a pastor&rsquo;s character, do 
        you think girls can be pastors?&rsquo; </p>
      <p>I know Baba got an answer from God at that moment. It comforts me so much to know that God was there with Baba at that moment.</p>

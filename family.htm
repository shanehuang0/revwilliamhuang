        <p align="left">Dear Jade, Shane, Charlotte and Christian, I just wanted 
          to share with you my love towards your father.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/2005-94.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
        <p align="left">Dear Hsing Wei,</p>
        <p align="left"> Thank you for reading your sermon first to me and asking 
          for my opinion on every single paper you wrote at Southwest Theological 
          Seminary. Sometimes I made unhelpful comments just want to shorten the 
          time of listening but I failed - you still read the next one to me.</p>
        <p align="left">Thank you for letting me do things my way even if it's 
          not always right. Most of all, thank you for your trust in me. You took 
          the kids to Malaysia with me because you believed that my birthplace 
          was the best place on earth and my way of growing up was a good way.</p>
        <p align="left"> Thank you for bringing home the news everyday. Remember 
          your loud red diesel truck? I just loved hearing that truck turn into 
          our street and see you show up at the door.</p>
        <p align="left"> Thank you for taking all the blame - remember I told 
          you last week I forgot to turn while I drove to Dallas because you were 
          on the phone? Actually I just enjoyed your voice.</p>
        <p align="left"> Thank you for analyzing my love toward you. You told 
          me I really really loved you because I not only have 4 kids with you, 
          but I love everyone of them dearly because they are from you.</p>
        <p align="left"> Thank you for telling me the stories of your childhood, 
          you said you promised yourself to die at age 39 like Jesus by changing 
          the world but you couldn't keep the promise because you didn't want 
          to leave me.</p>
        <p align="left">Thank you for answering the cell phone while you sang 
          karaoke with your friends even though you knew that meant the end of 
          singing.</p>
        <p align="left"> Finally, I Thank God for giving you to me as my life 
          partner and spiritual leader that I treasure so much.</p>
        <p align="left"> I will apply your faith and your love even now that you 
          are not with us. I promise you I will be fine and take good care of 
          myself.</p>

          </strong> <strong>(Jade&rsquo;s journal excerpt)</strong></p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Tues. 3/28/06</strong></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/2005-10.jpg" width="400" height="265"></p>
        <p align="left">That night when we celebrated Christian&rsquo;s birthday, 
          all I remember is how happy Baba was. He had been so busy with the restaurant 
          recently and to see him come home to make this event made it such a 
          special get together. He shared so many stories with the in-laws and 
          other friends there that night and was the life of the party &ndash; 
          like always. I remember whispering to Mom how amazing he was at telling 
          stories. It was like the 100th time I had heard some of the stories 
          he was telling, but he had a way of capturing my full attention and 
          making the story just as exciting as when he 1st told it. Christian 
          and his friends running around with his new toys, people laughing and 
          crowding around my father as he continued his entertaining and hilarious 
          stories, and the rest of us just stuffed our faces with food and wine. 
          There was so much love and laughter that filled the house that night. 
          Baba definitely enjoyed his last dinner just the way he liked it - he 
          ate the birthday cake before eating dinner even though I kept insisting 
          that would ruin his appetite. And he ate way too much steak, ignoring 
          my advice to not go for seconds because of the headaches he gets when 
          he eats too much red meat. I&rsquo;ll never forget when he sadly told 
          everyone he had to leave and close up the restaurant. That would be 
          the last time I would see Baba. Even when he got to the restaurant, 
          feeling like he was missing out, he called Mom for an update - curious 
          if everyone was still there. That would be the last time Mom would hear 
          his voice.</p>
        <p align="left">When the police were describing what had happened, 
          I kept asking why after he gave up the 1st opportunity to run away, 
          he was stupid enough to give up the 2nd. And then the 3rd. And then 
          the 4th, and on and on? The tape was silent. To me, the only explanation 
          for him staying around was if the women were screaming for Baba&rsquo;s 
          help. But the daughter told me that she kept yelling at my father to 
          leave, to run, to get away before he gets hurt by HER crazy father. 
          The police, the daughter, and the mother agreed that my father feared 
          for the life of the wife and circled the cars to stay near. I was so 
          angry and didn&rsquo;t understand how Baba could fear for these women&rsquo;s 
          lives so much more than his own. A lot of heroes give up their lives 
          for the ones they love. I don&rsquo;t know if there is even a word to 
          describe a hero that gives up his own life for people he barely knew.</p>
        <p align="left">I have spent most of my last 2 weeks by my mom&rsquo;s 
          side - eating almost every meal together, waking up next to her and 
          my little brother (with my patient husband and puppy sleeping in a sleeping 
          bag on the ground next to us). During these 2 weeks w/ my mom - talking 
          through our pain, laughing through our memories of Baba, crying through 
          how much we miss him and how if only we had just a little bit more time 
          with him - I constantly think why couldn&rsquo;t Baba be selfish JUST 
          ONCE? He would be here with us, telling us the exact details of how 
          he got away from a crazy man with a machete. He would be able to tell 
          that story more than a hundred times to millions of people, drawing 
          crowds as if it was his 1st time telling it. </p>
        <p align="left">But that&rsquo;s just not the way everything turned out 
          this time. Baba left this story for us to tell. I will tell it more 
          than a hundred times to millions of people over and over again with 
          no shame. It&rsquo;s Baba&rsquo;s turn to be proud of me as I tell people 
          the story of how my father gave up his own life to save 3&hellip;from 
          a crazy man with a machete.</p>

        <p align="center"><strong>Shane's Journal Entry</strong></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/family/ShanebdayDadSing.JPG" width="486" height="366"></p>
        <p align="left">It was early on a Saturday morning, and I was putting 
          on my tie to attend my father's funeral. My thoughts drifted back to 
          when my father taught me how to tie a tie one Easter morning. I remembered 
          that the first couple times I wore a tie, my dad would point out that 
          I hadn't folded the collar down properly over the tie, or my knot was 
          ugly. I smiled, thinking of all little things I learned from my father. 
          A wave of sadness hit me as I realized that there was so much more I 
          could have learned from him, if only it weren't too late. A barely formed 
          tear blurred my reflection in the mirror.</p>
        <p align="left">I thought of the email I found printed on his desk while 
          collecting his personal belongings. I had sent it a few weeks earlier 
          to both my parents, trying to show off what I had learned in Chinese 
          class. I wished I had called my dad more frequently. He had bought a 
          new antenna so that he could get better cell phone reception after we 
          had several conversations cut short. My mom told me how excited he would 
          be to talk to me, when I called once every week or two. I really should 
          have called more often.</p>
        <p align="left">It had been a rough week. Dealing with the death of a 
          beloved family member is always difficult, but coping with the unexpected, 
          abrupt, and violent end to my father's life was especially gut-wrenching. 
          I had barely recognized my father's pale disfigured face on his lifeless 
          body. I had seen his blood on the sidewalk, wall, and mailbox where 
          he was murdered, his skull split and shattered by multiple blows from 
          a steel machete. I had held his hand where the funeral home staff had 
          sewn his thumb back on. I was uneasy with the thought that my father's 
          murderer had escaped and was still not in custody.</p>
        <p align="left">I again rehearsed my eulogy in front of the mirror. I 
          reflected upon the fact that my father was a great public speaker who 
          loved to have any audience, and that I would be facing the largest audience 
          I had ever addressed. I was not nervous, and found myself confident 
          that a public speech should be easy for the oldest son of a man who 
          thrived on public speaking. In this way, my father's memory allowed 
          me to do what I had never been able to successfully do - give a memorized 
          speech in front of a large audience of people I did not really know 
          without nervous shaking in my voice or incoherent ramblings sprinkled 
          into my speech.</p>
        <p align="left">My father is the man who taught me the importance of serving. 
          He always wanted to improve the world and help the weak. One time when 
          he was young, he drew attention to a man on a train for hitting his 
          wife, screaming to all who could hear that &quot;THIS MAN IS A WIFE 
          BEATER! HE BEATS HIS WIFE! WIFE BEATER ON THE TRAIN!&quot; He had the 
          idealism of an adolescent and the boldness of a veteran salesman. He 
          served in long term relief missions in Taiwan after the earthquake of 
          1999, and had plans to do the same in the HIV-infested Henan Province 
          in China. He always wanted to help the poor in the United States, and 
          stressed the importance of giving back to the society that had granted 
          us the privileges we had. He rooted for the underdog in every sporting 
          event not involving the Houston Rockets, and felt the same way about 
          real life.</p>
        <p align="left">I miss my dad. I miss talking to him, and I miss trying 
          to seek his approval while showing him some recent accomplishment. It 
          didn't matter though; my father was proud of everything I did, even 
          if it wasn't special or all that impressive. He embarassed me more than 
          one time by bragging about my SAT and LSAT scores to my friends who 
          outscored me. He often fought to give us whatever he perceived as the 
          best - he put me in private school for 2 years because the public school 
          district where I was wouldn't let me be in the gifted class without 
          taking a test, and I only came back when I could be in the gifted class 
          while I waited for the next testing cycle. In the end, he really just 
          wanted the best for his children, and I will always remember him for 
          putting us first and making sure we had every opportunity to succeed.</p>

            <td width="99%" align="center" valign="top"><p><strong>Charlotte's 
                Journal Entry</strong> (15 yr old daughter)</p>
              <p align="left">My father was one very special person. I may not 
                know him entirely, but I feel very fortunate to be his daughter. 
                I remember always asking him questions about many things. I would 
                ask him homework related things, I&#8217;d ask him about God and 
                Christianity, Chinese, and just about anything that came to mind. 
                He would be patient with each and every question I&#8217;d ask 
                him and he&#8217;d elaborate on the response. By the time he was 
                done, I&#8217;d have a very detailed answer to my question.</p>
              <p align="left">I remember a time when he&#8217;d take me onto his 
                truck that he once owned. He would let me change the stick shift 
                and I remember having so much fun. He had full confidence that 
                I&#8217;d become this great driver. The thing I distinctly remember 
                about my father is that he&#8217;d always say he was going to 
                test me the following week about when to change the gear to the 
                car. The week would come and pass and I&#8217;d find myself wondering 
                which number to change it to. In the end, he would always tell 
                me exactly what to do, with extreme patience for someone who&#8217;s 
                driving. </p>
              <p align="left">I loved talking to him also because he&#8217;d always 
                tell me a story. Usually, it had something to do with his life 
                but it was always interesting. I never knew someone could have 
                so many stories. I was always laughing at his ridiculous incidents 
                and at awe at his courageous acts. It was his stories that made 
                my dad seem so alive. </p>
              <p align="left">Then, there are the times that we&#8217;d talk about 
                what I wanted. He would always listen to what I have to say and 
                tell me what was wrong with my view or how great my goal was. 
                I told him how I wanted to go to a good college and have a good 
                job and he&#8217;d tell me to go the extra mile. He&#8217;d tell 
                me to go to a great college and have an awesome job. It was always 
                about that extra effort that he pushed on me so I could aim higher 
                and have better achievements. </p>
              <p align="left">He was so supportive of everything I did. When I 
                played piano, he thought I&#8217;d be the best piano player in 
                the family. When I began golf, he had faith that I&#8217;d be 
                the next Michelle Wie. When debate entered my life, he strongly 
                believed that law was in my future. At times, I found myself envious 
                of his confidence in me. I couldn&#8217;t see why he would think 
                highly of me and I would not.</p>
              <p align="left">In the end, I realized that it was due to his love. 
                He had faith that I&#8217;d do great things because he saw me 
                through love. </p>

        <p><strong>My Brave Father<br>
          </strong> <strong> written by Christian</strong> (10 yr old son)</p>
        <p><img src="images/family/1998-1.JPG" width="534" height="356"></p>
        <p align="left">My father was a noble man, and he helps the family very 
          much. Sometimes he gave me a hard time, but I knew deep down inside 
          he cared about me. I never seen him much when he went to work, but I 
          spent valuable time with him. He made us all laugh and smile when he 
          was there. I will never forget the time he closed work late just for 
          my birthday party so I can feel better. My family was very happy with 
          him, and we would visit him while he&#8217;s working sometimes so we 
          can see him. </p>
        <p align="left">He could have made a lot of money that night for us but 
          he chose to go to my birthday party instead. After he died, I wanted 
          to make him feel special with his life. We never got to see him again 
          after my birthday party, I was very sad. The day he died he didn&#8217;t 
          beg for mercy, or run away, he died protecting a pregnant woman and 
          her 14 year old girl from a mad psycho that has a criminal record. He 
          taught me things like, setting up a tent, how to speak Chinese, and 
          how to save paper and recycle. He gave me a good life on my birthday 
          party and I never would forget him. </p>
        <p align="left">He went camping with me and let me play with friends. 
          When we were there, I had fun and he taught me how to build a tent and 
          had a good time. I promise I will never fight again after his death 
          because he wouldn't want me to. He never wanted me to fight with violence. 
          He loved the family and loved the life he had. The name of the psychotic 
          murderer is Leon Andrade, I would never forget the wretched name of 
          him.</p>
        <p align="left">I had a great time with him and the last words he said 
          to me was &#8220;you&#8217;re a special person,&#8221; because it was 
          my birthday. I never will forget him and his life. He was always there 
          for the family, and never taught us bad things because he was a good 
          man. He always celebrated everybody&#8217;s second digit birthday, and 
          made the best out of his life to make us happy.</p>
        <p align="left">I never wanted him to die before I went to college. I 
          always loved him as much as he loved me. I behaved at his funeral because 
          I was sad when he lost his life protecting innocent people. I never 
          forgot his death because he never would forget mine if it happened to 
          me. My family said he was in a better place and I&#8217;d meet him in 
          a few years.</p>
        <p align="left">I promise I would make him proud by going to a good college 
          and take care of my mom. I will try to remember him and never forget 
          him even if I am having a rough time. I will never ever make him feel 
          bad and I will always love him. <br>

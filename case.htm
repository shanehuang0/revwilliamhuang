      <p align="center"><strong>Circumstances of the Murder<br>
        </strong>(last updated 8/09/2006)</p>
      <p> My father, Reverend William Huang, bought Lucky Seafood Market in December 
        2005 to support the family. Starting in February 2006 - my father was 
        finally able to hire enough employees so that he did not have to be as 
        hands on &ndash; this gave him more time to spend with the family in the 
        evenings. On the night of the murder, our family was celebrating my youngest 
        brother&rsquo;s 10 th birthday. At around 8:45pm , my father informed 
        us and the guests that he was going to go close up the store. </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/andrade.jpg" width="263" height="333"></p>
      <p>Leon Lugo Andrad&eacute;, a man with a history of violence, had a protective 
        order against him for over a year for regularly beating his wife and children 
        throughout their relationship. Just in Houston alone, Andrad&eacute; has 
        a long criminal record starting with a murder/manslaughter 15 years, continuing 
        with numerous DWI&rsquo;s, firing a weapon and carrying a shotgun in a 
        public place. When the wife finally left him, he became increasingly threatening, 
        forcing his ex-wife and children to move every few months When Andrad&eacute; 
        finally located his ex-wife&rsquo;s sister, he threatened her with a gun 
        in trying to locate his ex-wife. This ex-wife was recently hired by my 
        father and the daughter would come to the store everyday after school 
        to be with her mom. The mother had told my father about her ex-husband 
        being abusive and how she feared him &ndash; and that calling the police 
        never helped since the police were always a step behind. </p>
      <p>On the day of the murder, Andrad&eacute; again threatened his ex-wife&rsquo;s 
        sister at her home. Distraught, the sister came to work to warn the ex-wife 
        and daughter. The police believe that is when Andrad&eacute; followed 
        her to my father&rsquo;s restaurant and waited for his ex-wife to emerge. 
        Later when my father came back to the restaurant ready to close up, the 
        daughter told him that she may have seen her father&rsquo;s car driving 
        by earlier. My father offered to make sure they made it safely to their 
        car. Right after my father finished locking the doors, Andrad&eacute; 
        appeared and began arguing with his wife in Spanish and asking who my 
        father was. The daughter and mother insisted that he was just their boss 
        in their new jobs. The daughter then hugged her father and said in Spanish, 
        &ldquo;He is Mom&rsquo;s new boss because you never give us money!!&rdquo; 
        Andrade started showing violence towards his wife at this point and my 
        father tried to go in to protect her. Andrade threatened my father and 
        the daughter suggested to my father to hurry up and leave before something 
        happens to him. However, an already wild Andrad&eacute; turned on my father. 
        At this point, my father replied with a suggestion that he calm down, 
        since nobody wanted trouble. Andrad&eacute; returned to his van, retrieved 
        a machete and began to chase my father around his car. The surveillance 
        camera shows that they circled the cars several times during the chase, 
        and my father had numerous opportunities to escape. It was only 10:20pm 
        when these events started and there were tons of cars passing by on the 
        busy street in front of the parking lot. The police, mother, and daughter 
        agree that my father feared for the life of the wife and circled the cars 
        to stay near. Eventually, my father fell. Andrad&eacute; forced him into 
        the alley next to the restaurant and struck him with multiple blows to 
        the head. My father attempted to defend himself by putting up his arms 
        to block the machete, and received large gashes on his hand and forearm 
        and losing his thumb. The right side of his face had been split open in 
        3 places. The back of his skull had been shattered leaving a gaping hole 
        in the back of his head. Andrad&eacute; immediately drove off in his green 
        van when witnesses started to show up after hearing the screams from the 
        women. My father&rsquo;s actions bought enough time to save the life of 
        the woman and her daughter. A witness arrived on the scene to catch the 
        last machete blow and license plate on the green van while Andrad&eacute; 
        fled. The daughter explained how Andrad&eacute; could not accept the facts 
        that he didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;own&rdquo; her mom anymore and that they weren&rsquo;t 
        dependent on him anymore. </p>
      <p>My mother woke up around 4:00AM Monday morning ready for her commute 
        and noticed my father didn&rsquo;t come home. She called his cell phone 
        and restaurant phone and started getting worried that he may have gotten 
        into an accident on the way home. After several more attempts with no 
        answer, she decided to drive to the restaurant and pulled up to the parking 
        lot where there were local media camera crews and two security guards 
        - but no sign of police cars. She received hints from a news reporter 
        that a man named Elvis (my father&rsquo;s nickname) was killed but she 
        didn&rsquo;t believe the reporter since nobody notified her. The police 
        arrived on the scene after the security guard notified them. The police 
        then called my sister, Jade to come to the scene. When Jade arrived, the 
        police confirmed the story that my father was in fact killed trying to 
        protect the ex-wife and daughter.</p>
      <p>US Marshals arrested Andrade in Elkins, West Virginia on August 7, 2006, and brought 
        him back to Texas to face murder charges.</p>
      <p>On August 29, 2007, after a 3-day trial, a jury convicted Leon Lugo Andrade 
        of murdering William Hsing Wei Huang with a deadly weapon. They sentenced him 
        to life in prison. Andrade will be eligible for parole after having served 30 
        years (including time spent in jail awaiting the outcome of this case).</p>

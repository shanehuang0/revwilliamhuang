      <strong>1944 - 2006</strong></p>
      <p>My father&rsquo;s passion in life was helping people, especially strangers. 
        He always initiated his own mission trips overseas wherever he saw a need, 
        touching many lives in the process. Whenever news hit reporting natural 
        disasters or something major happening in other countries, we knew we 
        wouldn&rsquo;t see our father for a while since he would be there in a 
        heartbeat. There was no limit to his love. Contributing with donations 
        was not enough for him &ndash; he had to get physically involved in these 
        organizations all around the world. One of the most recent projects he 
        wanted to get involved with was going to the Henan Province in China where 
        up to 40% are HIV positive. Even among missions trips, this was definitely 
        &ldquo;less glamorous&rdquo; &ndash; many missionaries were hesitant to 
        go to this region of China. To my father, this was more of a reason to 
        go. Our family discouraged his idealism strongly but my father continued 
        talking about it in hopes we would change our mind. After the recent tragedy, 
        the family has decided to support in physical and financial forms towards 
        these charities in his memory.</p>
      <div class="grey1px">
        <p>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the family at 
          <a href="mailto:revhuang@gmail.com">revhuang@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <td><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="body" -->Yesterday, I went to a conference 
      with Anson and a bunch of his friends. The worship was what we were all 
      looking forward to. Upon arrival, we eagerly went to the best seats we could 
      find. Then at 7, they did communion and then we waited until 8 and the worship 
      began. It was great and Anson was so enthusiastic about the drummer and 
      things of that sort. 
      <p>I email you guys for two things: yesterday's message and Baba. Yesterday's 
        message was a very powerful message. The speaker talked about what the 
        cross costed God. Many of us would automatically think &quot;Well, the 
        cross was Jesus' death. It was physical pain that he had to pay.&quot; 
        But what is torture to someone divine? What is death to someone eternal? 
        And then he asked again what did the cross cost God? </p>
      <p>There were clips of The Passion in the background as he spoke about the 
        many things Jesus had to endure. And he said that there is a form of torture 
        that exists now that can break a human's spirit and soul. It's where you 
        torture someone and make them feel pain. Then you take their child and 
        make them watch as they tortured their child. Because of someone's great 
        love for their child, it is the purest form of torture.</p>
      <p>So then, he tells us about how God the father had to watch God the son(Jesus) 
        go through all this. God the father had to go and let Jesus die. Jesus 
        knew he'd be forsaken by others, he knew he'd be persecuted wrongly, he 
        knew his disciples would abandon him in fear of their own lives, but when 
        he asked the question &quot;Abba, why have you forsaken me?&quot;, it 
        was heartbreaking. To have a child ask a parent &quot;Why do you hate 
        me?&quot; is such a killing question. Because of God's great love of us 
        as people, did he let his one and only son die. Because he loved us and 
        cared for us so much, he let his son die the harshest death they had to 
        offer.</p>
      <p>I wanted to also share that I've realized that Baba died in the same 
        sense as Jesus. I know that you guys already know that but I'd like to 
        share anyway. He was wrongly killed, he was killed mercilessly, and he 
        died because he loved and cared for his workers. His love must be very 
        great to be able to have the will to die for someone he doesn't have to 
        die for. In the same way, Jesus died for us because he loved us. He died 
        for us to save us. He didn't have to die. He didn't have to do any of 
        that. He could have saved himself if he wanted to. But our God is such 
        a selfless God. Baba was such a selfless person. </p>
      <p>You guys ask me why I'm not angry. The answer I have to give is simply 
        because I don't see the need of getting angry. Baba died a heroic death 
        and I honor him for that. There are things that happen because they were 
        meant to. Jesus was betrayed by Judas because someone had to betray him. 
        Jesus was meant to die on the cross. I think Baba was meant to die for 
        the sake of three lives and the capture of one killer. True, that doesn't 
        justify Andrade killing Baba but I just feel like this is God's plan and 
        anger will only make ourselves worse. </p>
      <p>I have 100% faith that this guy will be caught.</p>

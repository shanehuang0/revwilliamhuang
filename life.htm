      <p align="left">William Huang was born on November 20, 1944 in Henyang, 
        Hunan, China. He showed his love of music at an early age, learning to 
        sing and whistle before his third birthday. Because his father was a Nationalist 
        Party (Kuomintang) 2 star General, his family fled to Chunli, Taiwan to 
        escape war when William was 8. His love of music first attracted him to 
        the local Baptist church, where he was baptized in 1956.</p>
      <p> In 1963, William Huang began his studies in the Chemical Engineering 
        Department at Chung Yuan Christian University in Chunli, Taiwan. As a 
        class clown and frequent troublemaker, he often found himself facing disciplinary 
        action at his university. Because of this, he found himself forced to 
        attend a Christian student retreat in early 1967, where he received his 
        born again experience. He had been called by God to serve in ministry 
        throughout his life, and began to find ways to serve. He graduated with 
        a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering in 1967. After a 
        year of service in the Republic of China Air Force as a second lieutenant, 
        he worked as a Production Manager at General Instruments in Taiwan. During 
        this time, he also served as a deacon and choir director at St. James 
        Methodist Church in Taipei.</p>
      <p>William Huang immigrated to the United States in 1970, and graduated 
        from Georgia Institute of Technology in 1972 with a Master of Science 
        degree in Chemical Engineering. He then worked as an Air Pollution Engineer 
        for Rossnagel &amp; Associates for two years. During his four years in 
        Atlanta, he also served as the music conductor in the Atlanta Chinese 
        Christian Fellowship.</p>
      <p align="left">After working a year as a Process Engineer at Midrex Corporation, 
        William decided that it was time to pursue full-time ministry, and moved 
        to Los Angeles to serve at the House of Disciples. </p>
      <p> Financial considerations forced William to return to work, which brought 
        him to Houston, Texas in 1976. He served in the University of Houston 
        Chinese Christian Student Fellowship as a counselor, and as a Sunday School 
        Teacher at Houston Chinese Church. At the University of Houston, he met 
        Lena in a bible study in 1976. They were married in 1978, and Lena gave 
        birth to their oldest daughter, Jade. In 1983, they had their second child, 
        Shane. In 1988, he received his M.A. in Communication (TV Production) 
        at Wheaton College in Illinois. </p>
      <p> From 1988 to 1993, William served as a Youth Counselor in Grace Memorial 
        Baptist Church in Houston. In 1990, William and Lena had their third child, 
        Charlotte. In 1993, William began studying at Southwestern Baptist Theological 
        Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. In 1994, William Huang was ordained by 
        the Baptist Pastors Committee, and began serving as Pastor of New Life 
        Baptist Church in Houston. His fourth child, Christian, was born in 1996. 
        He received his 3rd Masters Degree - Master of Divinity from Southwestern 
        in 1998. Also in 1998, William started Melody of Life Ministries, a ministry 
        to reflect his passion for both missions and music. With Melody of Life, 
        he frequently served overseas in missions to provide relief to the poor 
        or weak, especially after disaster. He had served in Taiwan after the 
        earthquake of 1999, and also ministered to the impoverished people of 
        Southeast Asia. In 2000, he started the Doctor of Ministry program at 
        Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. </p>
      <p> Throughout the years of ministry, he also had to help support the family. 
        His extremely long list of professions included Real Estate Broker, restaurant 
        owner, furniture business, granite/marble contractor, and car detailing 
        business just to name a few. He was also very extremely involved in the 
        Asian community and served as an MC, comedian, talk show host, play actor, 
        etc. at many events in the states as well as overseas. He took all these 
        opportunities to reach out to those that would not have ever set foot 
        in church. To reach out beyond church doors was not only his passion, 
        but his vision.</p>
      <p> William and his family returned to the United States in 2005, as both 
        he and Lena continued looking for work. He purchased the Lucky Seafood 
        Market in December 2005 in an attempt to financially support the family 
        and his ministry. There he found himself extremely happy, singing to every 
        customer that walked in and shared the gospel to anyone that cared to 
        listen. He came home every night with stories of the different people 
        he met and sang to. <br>
        He had intended to raise funds to serve in Henan Province, China, where 
        his heart was touched by the suffering caused by the high rate of HIV 
        infection and AIDS related deaths among people too poor for treatment.</p>
